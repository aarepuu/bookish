# Peruse
This is a simple framework for publishing online books. I originally created it to make it easier to maintain the many online books on my website (amyjko.com), while adding more sophisticated features to support reading.

## Viewing Books Locally

To build assets and view a book on a local server, you can use the following command (after install dependecies with npm):

```language:bash
$ npm run book -- path/to/book
```

For example, the following command will open a new browser tab with an example tutorial book:

```language:bash
$ npm run book -- examples/tutorial
```
