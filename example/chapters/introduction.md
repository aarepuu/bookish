Welcome to the Peruse example book! This introduction contains all of the features supported by peruse.

For example, you can create top level headers by starting a line with the pound symbol #:

# This is a header

Peruse doesn't support numbered headers or subheaders yet; we're going to keep it simple at first.

# Formatting text

There are many ways to format text.

It can be _italic_ by wrapping text with the \_ symbol.

It can be *bold* by wrapping text with the \* symbol.

It can be both *_bold and italic_* by wrapping it with both \*\_.

It can be in bullet form by starting a line with \*:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

It can be in numbered form by staring a line with a number followed by a period:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

(The numbers don't have to be in a particular order, they just have to be a number).
